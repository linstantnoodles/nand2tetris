# nand2tetris-solutions

My solutions to each project in the wonderful [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. Each project directory also includes `notes.md` document containing tips, explanations, and ramblings.

nand2tetris is available as two separate courses on coursera:

1. Part 1: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris
2. Part 2: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II 

* Folders `01` through `06` in this repo correspond to the actual nand2tetris project numbers in the first part of the course. The final project is an assembler for the HACK assembly language.
* The `vm-translator` folder contains my work for nand2tetris project 7 & 8 where you build the virtual machine language translator.
* The `09` folder contains a program I wrote for project 9 using JACK (a high level, OO, java-like language).
* The `jack-compiler` folder contains my work for projects 10 * 11 where you build a compiler for the JACK.
* Finally, the `os-services` folder contains my work for project 12 (final project) where you build a suite of operating system services using JACK that can ultimately boot and run your machine!

## Is the code tested? 

Yes! Every solution has been tested with the courses built-in test scripts. I've also written some of my own tests for some of the programming assignments. You'll find instructions on how to run my tests in the notes. 

## Your code does not follow their API guidelines! 

So I did go a bit rouge on some of the programming portions, so my design may not line up with what they suggest. That said, I'm considering adding additional solutions that _are_ based on their API guidelines so stay tuned.

## Feedback
I would love to know if anything can be made better. Please let me know by submitting a PR!
