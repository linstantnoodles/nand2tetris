# nand2tetris-solutions

My solutions to each project in the wonderful [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. Each project directory also includes `notes.md` document containing tips, explanations, and ramblings.

## Is the code tested? 

Yes! Every solution has been tested with the courses built-in test scripts. I've also written some of my own tests for some of the programming assignments. You'll find instructions on how to run my tests in the notes. 

## I think your solution can be improved

I would love to know if anything can be made better. Please let me know by submitting a PR!

## Your directory structure doesn't line up with mine!

I did my best to organized the solutions according to the original project layout but it's possible that the course changed since I last took it (late 2019).
